# OpenGov Public API

OpenGov automates the extraction of structure data from unstructured (or just differently-formatted) data on the web through a public API. OpenGov uses ML and a slew of workers to efficently scrape and parse data from large sets of web pages.

# Usage

The public API is currently available at https://opengov-api.herokuapp.com
